<P>A popular version control software is subversion (svn), and it can be used to keep track of all versions of ﬁles as they change over time. Roughly speaking, it only stores diﬀerences and works in a client-server model. This makes it eﬃcient and useful. The storehouse of the ﬁles is a repository and the user’s local copy is called as a working copy. You can checkout a part or all of the repository into your working copy, work on the ﬁles locally and when done, commit them back to the repository. The URL for the repository for our course is: 
<Link>https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/fa10-cs357. </Link>
</P>

<P>Let’s assume that the envrionment variable SVNCOURSE has been set to this URL. This can be done as follows. For users of bash shell, append the following to the .bashrc ﬁle: </P>

<P>% SVNCOURSE=above-mentioned-URL; export SVNCOURSE </P>

<P>For the those using the tsch shell, append the following to the the .cshrc ﬁle: </P>

<P>% setenv SVNCOURSE above-mentioned-URL </P>

<P>Typing </P>

<P>% source .bashrc </P>

<P>or </P>

<P>% source .cshrc </P>

<P>respectively will immediately implement these changes. Once they are made, they will be in eﬀect each time a new terminal window is started. </P>

<P>The whole repository can be checked out to a local working copy by going to your home directory and typing </P>

<P>1 </P>

<P>% svn checkout $SVNCOURSE cs357 </P>

<P>at the system prompt. Now cs357 contains all the ﬁles and directories of the repository and is your working copy. </P>

<P>If you create a new directory, say hw01 or ﬁle hw01/hw01.py, you can add the directory as well as all ﬁles it contains to the repository by </P>

<P>% svn add hw01 </P>

<P>Files and symbolic links can be individually added similarly. Added stuﬀ remains local until you commit. This is done by </P>

<P>% svn commit </P>

<P>or </P>

<P>% svn ci </P>

<P>This form of the command is likely to take you to an editor and expect you to enter comments on what changes you are commiting. This is optional. You can quit out of the editor to continue the commit process. But it is a good idea to enter some short comments. A quick way is to use the form </P>

<P>% svn ci -m &quot;added definitive proof, P is NOT equal to NP" </P>

<P>or </P>

<P>% svn ci -m &quot;" </P>

<P>if you are feeling lazy and want to annoy your collaborators who will have to wait for the media release about your great proof. In these forms the trip to the editor is skipped. The comments entered during commit are visible by using </P>

<P>% svn log </P>

<P>c</P>

<P>which also shows the time stamp, thereby discouraging students from submitting labs late and thus instilling great civic spirit in society and good work ethic that will last a lifetime :-). </P>

<P>Others (say, your instructor) may add ﬁles and directories to the repository from time to time. You can keep your local copy fresh by updating it. You can easily do this by changing directory to your local copy at the system prompt and issuing </P>

<P>% svn update </P>

<P>or, simply, </P>

<P>% svn up </P>

<P>Although svn is meant to be easy and intuitive, things can, sometimes, (and, perhaps, in the beginning, most often will) go wrong. A commit or an update may fail and cause endless agony. Often encountered is the painful working directory locked locked error. In case of errors, you should ﬁrst attempt </P>

<P>% svn cleanup </P>

<P>at your working directory and pray that everything should be ﬁne! Otherwise, a useful command that often helps to remedy the situation is </P>

<P>% svn status </P>

<P>that roughly tells us whether the working copy ﬁles are newer or older than that of the repository’s or whether there is a conﬂict between the two ﬁles or some other clue that can be used to resolve the errors. </P>

<P>Of course, all of this is just the tip of iceberg (or, head of the linked list). When you are feeling geeky, you can enjoy exploring more svn commands at
